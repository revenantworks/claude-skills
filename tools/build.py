"""claude-skills — multi-pack build: sync, validate, package.

Single source of truth: the pack tables in
packs/foundation/skills/revenantworks-foundation-skillwright/references/pack-registry.md.
Every pack under packs/ is derived from its `**<pack> members**` table there —
no second manifest to drift. The marketplace catalog is cross-checked, not derived.

Validation covers frontmatter identity/description/body limits, CHANGELOG-version
agreement, and the `metadata.volatile` block (U-7): legal classes, and for
calendar-class surfaces a sane cadence, an existing file, and a dated header stamp.

The routing-seam table rides the same registry pipeline as the roster (1.2.0 item ①):
authored once under `**<pack> seams**`, generated into every member's pack.md, and
boundary-pair checked — both members in the roster, no self-pairs, no empty ownership
or signal cell, no pair declared twice with conflicting ownership, and the table present
and complete in all N manifests.

Usage:
  python3 tools/build.py            sync pack.md -> all members in all packs, validate, build dist/ zips
  python3 tools/build.py --check    CI mode: validate + report drift, write nothing, exit 1 on any problem
  python3 tools/build.py --only revenantworks-foundation-tokenwright   limit zip build to one member (sync still runs)
  python3 tools/build.py --bump-pack <pack> <X.Y.Z>   one-stroke version write: marketplace entry +
                                    pack plugin.json + root CHANGELOG scaffold (prevents split-brain bumps)
  python3 tools/build.py --parity   diff EVERY shipped file in both installed copies against repo HEAD —
                                    the marketplace clone AND the plugin cache Claude Code actually loads;
                                    exit 1 on drift; skips cleanly when no local install exists (CI-safe)
  python3 tools/build.py --footprint  measured SKILL.md body tokens per member against its registry budget,
                                    plus the pack total; report only, writes nothing, never fails

Validation also covers (added 2026-07-24): pack plugin.json == marketplace entry version
(hard fail — the split-brain class), eval provenance freshness and eval-table orphan
rows (hard fail — flipped 2026-08-07 after the 2.0.0 tag, as promised), description >=1000 chars and
and body footprint. The footprint gate was RESCOPED 2026-07-25: >500 body lines stays a hard fail (the
agentskills.io norm), while the 5k-token figure is this pack's own advisory and now gates on whether the
overage is DECLARED — a member over it must carry a budget {tokens, why}. Undeclared overage hard-fails
(flipped 2026-08-07, the promised next-tag flip); exceeding your own declared budget warns as drift. MOVED 2026-07-27: for a pack
member the budget lives in the registry's `**<pack> budgets**` table, not in frontmatter — frontmatter is
loaded on every invocation, so a `why` there cost 51-95 tokens per run to explain a build-time number.
A registry row costs zero runtime tokens, which is what makes declaring ALL members affordable rather
than only the over-advisory ones. Standalone skills outside a pack keep the frontmatter form.

Stdlib only. Run from the repo root (or anywhere; paths resolve from this file).

    TWO surfaces drift independently, and checking only the first is how a session kept
    loading a superseded member while this command reported clean (2026-08-01, promptwright
    1.1.0):

      clone — ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/<mkt>, a git clone that moves only on
              /plugin marketplace update. It served pre-1.1.0 descriptions for a month.
      cache — ~/.claude/plugins/cache/<mkt>/<pack>/<version>/, the copy Claude Code actually
              LOADS, written only on /plugin install|update. A refreshed clone does not move
              it: the clone is where an update reads FROM, the cache is what it writes TO,
              so clone-clean and cache-stale is a real and silent state.

    Note the cache flattens the pack root — `skills/<member>/`, not `packs/<pack>/skills/`.
    Each surface skips cleanly when absent (CI-safe).

    Scope is EVERY shipped file, not just SKILL.md frontmatter. The narrow version reported
    clean twice while the loaded copy was stale, because the files that lagged — `ledger.md`,
    `spec.md` — are not frontmatter and were never compared. Line endings are normalised: a
    CRLF working tree against an LF clone is not drift.
