"""Unit tests for build.py's registry parsers — the single point every manifest
derives from. Guards the regex-table bug class that has bitten twice: the
budgets table matching the roster regex (16 = 16 = 16 on an eight-member pack)
and the parser edits that shipped unexercised ("unit blindness").

Run: python3 -m unittest discover -s tools -p "test_*.py"
