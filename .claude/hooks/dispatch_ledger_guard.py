"""dispatch_ledger_guard.py — PreToolUse hook (matcher: Task|Agent|Workflow) for
revenantworks-foundation-dispatchwright.

Fixed 2026-08-18 — four fail-open defects, all reproduced on the live file
before the fix. The selftest below covers each one end to end; if you edit this
file, run `--selftest` and expect it to fail loudly rather than quietly pass.

  D1  NO SESSION ID WAS A TOTAL NO-OP. `flag_is_live` returned False whenever
      the payload carried no session id, so every Task/Agent/Workflow call
      without one sailed past the guard. Now a fresh flag with a session id the
      guard cannot correlate ENFORCES the ledger check instead of skipping it.
  D2  EXIT 1 ON ANY EXCEPTION. Claude Code blocks a PreToolUse call only on
      exit code 2; 1 is a non-blocking error. Only json.load was wrapped, so a
      throw anywhere later failed OPEN. The whole body is wrapped now and every
      path returns 0 or 2. Never 1.
  D3  A STALE LEDGER DISARMED THE GUARD FOREVER. find_ledger took the newest
      ledger by mtime with no age limit and no tie to the live run, so one old
      populated ledger in a directory passed every dispatch there for good. A
      ledger now has to sit inside the same staleness window that keeps the
      flag live, or name the current session outright.
  D4  JUNK CELLS COUNTED AS TIERED. `_populated` rejected only "", "-" and the
      em dash, so a row of TBD / ? / x satisfied "names its model, effort and
      surface". The three cells are now validated per field.

Pairs with dispatch_gate.py. That hook sets a mode-flag file
(`~/.claude/dispatch-mode.json`, session id + timestamp) when a prompt looks
like a fan-out. This hook reads it on every Task/Agent/Workflow call:

  - Flag absent, unreadable, stale, or owned by a DIFFERENT session -> exit 0.
    Dispatch mode is not active here; there is nothing to enforce.
  - Flag live for this session, or fresh but not correlatable -> the run ledger
    must exist, must be current, and must carry a properly tiered row. Anything
    else exits 2 with a short reason on stderr.

This is deliberately a coarse check, stated plainly rather than overclaimed: it
confirms *a* tiered row exists in the run's current ledger, not that the
SPECIFIC unit about to be dispatched has one -- correlating a Task call's own
tool_input against a specific ledger row would need a unit id the tool_input
has no standard place to carry. The coarse form still catches the failure mode
that matters most: a wave launched with a missing, stale, or untiered ledger.

Extended 2026-08-20 (skillwright pack audit, finding P1-2 / S-3): SKILL.md
section 6 states two wave-execution caps in prose -- max 6 concurrent units,
one writer per repo -- that nothing here enforced before this change; the
guard only ever proved a row existed, never that dispatching one more unit
would stay inside either cap. Both new checks (open_unit_count,
repo_collision) share the same coarse-by-necessity limitation as the check
above: they read the ledger AS IT STANDS and block when it already shows a
cap violated, rather than simulating what the specific about-to-run call would
do. Given the ledger row for a unit is written before its dispatch call fires
(SKILL.md section 5), the row for the call under the guard's own PreToolUse
hook is already in the ledger by the time these run, so "already violated"
correctly includes that unit.

Extended 2026-09-11 (task-observer observation #0022): open_unit_count()
counted ROWS, and a Workflow call is one row however many agents its own
script spawns -- three rows once hid 245 refuter agents from the 6-unit cap
and the usage-window check in the same run. A row whose `surface` cell states
an agent-count token -- written as the literal text `x<N>` somewhere in the
cell, e.g. `subagent (workflow) x245` (SKILL.md section 6's own worked form)
-- now counts as N units against the cap, not 1. `agent_multiplier()` parses
the token; a missing or malformed one (no digits, a non-positive count, `x`
with nothing after it) defaults to 1, the same as a row with no token at all,
so a normal single-agent row is never penalized and a broken token never
silently zeroes a row out of the count.

FAILS CLOSED whenever it is armed and cannot prove the dispatch is tiered --
that is the point of this hook. dispatch_gate.py is the opposite and must stay
that way: it runs on every prompt, and a gate that can block is how the
2026-08-18 incident locked the owner out of a whole session.

Run `python dispatch_ledger_guard.py --selftest` to exercise the flag logic,
the ledger currency rule, the cell validators, and the real exit codes of all
four defects against temp fixtures. Stdlib only.

# D4 -- what counts as a tiered cell.
#
# The rule, stated once so it does not need editing every time a model ships:
#
#   model    Must not be a known placeholder token, must contain a letter, and
#            must look like a NAME rather than a word: it carries a digit
#            (gpt-5, o3, Haiku 4.5) or joins two alphanumeric chunks with a
#            space, hyphen, dot, slash, underscore or colon (Claude Opus,
#            claude-opus-5). No list of model names appears anywhere here, so a
#            model released tomorrow passes on the day it ships while "TBD",
#            "?", "x", "auto" and "model" all fail.
#   effort   A genuinely closed vocabulary -- the harness defines it, not the
#            model vendors, so enumerating it is safe and it does not churn.
#            The cell passes if any of those words appears in it, which lets
#            "high", "effort: high" and "high (extended thinking)" through.
#   surface  Free text by design (subagent (background), main conversation, a
#            worktree name). No vocabulary is possible, so the bar is: not a
#            placeholder, at least four characters, and it contains a letter.
#            That rejects the junk a hurried row carries without pretending to
#            validate something this hook cannot see.
#
# The check is a floor, not a proof. It stops an untiered row, not a wrong one.
