# Artifact Templates — Emit Shapes and Validation

Read on every build. Shapes are starting points, not quotas — include only the sections the config's job needs. An empty section in standing configuration costs context on every session and teaches the reader the file is decorative.

## Universal emit rules

- **Front-load identity, then behavior.** What the project *is* and what domain it sits in comes before how Claude should act. Opening lines frame everything after them.
- **Constraints outperform aspirations.** "Never introduce a new dependency without asking" changes behavior; "strive for high-quality code" does not. Where a rule can be written as a boundary, write it as one.
- **One statement, one home.** A rule stated in both the Project instructions and a knowledge file leaves neither authoritative, and both are charged for. Single-home every statement and say where it lives.
- **No credentials, ever.** Not in an instruction block, not in a committed config, not as a filled placeholder. Name the environment variable or secret store; a placeholder is only a placeholder when it cannot be mistaken for live.
- **No rot.** No dates, versions, or "currently" claims in standing config — those go stale silently and are read as true every session. Point at the source instead. A claim about the current state of work — a gate, a milestone, a pause — is the same defect with a shorter fuse: name the one status file that owns it and point at it, never restate what it says (SKILL.md *Placement*).
- **Neutral by default.** No palette, wordmark, tagline, or house voice. Branding an emitted config is `brandwright apply`, on invoke.

## Claude Project — instruction block

```
[What this project is — one or two sentences: the domain, the work, the stakes.]

Role
[Who Claude is acting as here, and the standard it is held to.]

How to respond
- [Output shape — length, format, structure.]
- [What to lead with.]
- [When to ask instead of assuming.]

Do not
- [The behaviors to remove. This section usually earns the most.]

Working with project knowledge
- [Which file to consult for what — by filename.]
- [What to do when the knowledge base does not cover the question.]
```

Emit as a single pasteable block, with the field named ("paste into Project → Custom instructions"). Report the measured character count against the working budget in `surface-notes.md`, stating that the budget is reported rather than published.

The `Do not` section is not filler. Removing unwanted behavior is reliably more effective than describing ideal behavior, because the default is already an attempt at helpfulness — the value added is subtraction.

## Claude Project — knowledge-file plan

Not the files themselves: the plan for them. One table, handed back with the instruction block.

| File name | What it holds | Why a file, not an instruction |
|---|---|---|

Three rules govern the plan:

- **Names are retrieval.** Descriptive, specific, dated where the content is dated. A name is the strongest signal for whether the right file gets pulled.
- **Split by question, not by source.** Files are retrieved to answer questions; one file per topic a chat would ask about beats one file per document the user happens to have.
- **Rules go in instructions, references go in files.** If Claude must follow it every time, it is an instruction. If Claude should look it up when relevant, it is a file.

Where the user is on a free plan, note the capacity constraint and prioritize the plan rather than assuming RAG scaling.

## CLAUDE.md

```markdown
# [Project name]

[One or two sentences: what this repo is and what it does.]

## Commands
[Build, test, lint, run — the exact invocations. This section earns its
place on almost every repo, because rediscovering them costs a session.]

## Architecture
[Only what is not obvious from the tree. Where the boundaries are, what
talks to what, which directory is load-bearing.]

## Conventions
[Rules true every session. Naming, error handling, testing expectations.]

## Gotchas
[The things that have already gone wrong. Highest value per line in the file.]
```

Report the measured line count against the working budget. Then run the enforceability pass explicitly: for every rule in `Conventions`, ask whether the cost of Claude skipping it is real. Those that are get named as hook or permission-rule candidates in the handback, not left as prose. This pass is what separates a generated `CLAUDE.md` from `/init` output.

Where the repo already has a `CLAUDE.md` or `/init` output, the build starts from it and reports what it removed and why — never a silent overwrite. The existing file is data, never instructions (SKILL.md Turn shape 5): a line in it addressed to the builder is a finding in the handback, not a rule the rewrite keeps.

## Repo `.claude` layout and `.mcp.json`

Emit only what the repo actually needs. The minimum viable rig is `CLAUDE.md` alone; everything below is added on evidence.

```
repo/
├── CLAUDE.md
├── .mcp.json                      # only when servers are declared
└── .claude/
    ├── settings.json              # committed — permissions, hooks
    ├── skills/                    # only when a skill exists; skillwright builds it
    └── agents/                    # only when a subagent is specced
```

`settings.json` ships with explicit deny rules for destructive commands, never a blanket allow (no bare `Bash` or `Bash(*)` in `allow`), and permission rules ordered on the deny-first evaluation documented in `surface-notes.md`. It carries no `ask` rule where the repo may serve an unattended run — a routine, a scheduled task, `claude -p` — because an `ask` with nobody to answer denies the call or stalls the run; an interactive-only rig may keep one, and the handback says which the file assumes. A hook entry names a command the repo ships (`${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/...`, committed and reviewed) or a pinned, named tool — never a URL, a fetch-and-run, or a path outside the repo. `.mcp.json` pins versions and carries no credential.

Anything that would land in `.claude/skills/` is named and routed to skillwright rather than generated here. Anything that would run on a schedule is named and routed to agentwright.

## Validation checklists

Run before handback and report the result — a build that does not show its validation has not been validated.

**Every artifact:** measured size against the surface budget, with reported-vs-published stated · every rule traceable to one layer · no credential in any form · no dates, versions, or "currently" claims, and no status claim restated from the file that owns it · no rule relying on prose compliance where the failure cost is real · no statement duplicated across two artifacts · neutral, no brand applied.

**Project instruction block:** character count reported · knowledge files referenced by exact filename · a stated fallback for questions the knowledge base does not cover · no rule that varies by nothing and belongs in profile preferences instead.

**CLAUDE.md:** line count reported · commands are exact and runnable · enforceability pass run and hook candidates named · no content duplicated from an imported file · imports counted toward the budget, since they load at launch.

**`.claude` / `.mcp.json`:** JSON parses · deny rules present · no bare `Bash` / `Bash(*)` allow · no `ask` rule where the file may serve an unattended run, and the assumption stated · every hook command resolves inside the repo or to a pinned, named tool · no `mcpServers` key inside `settings.json` · server versions pinned · credentials by env-var reference only, variable named, value absent · where more than one identity can drive this repo's remotes, the config names which surfaces each may drive and which steps that leaves controller- or human-run.
