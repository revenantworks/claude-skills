# Trigger Evals — revenantworks-foundation-rigwright

**Provenance:** authored against `revenantworks-foundation-rigwright` v1.0.0, description at 946 characters. Re-anchor this line on any version bump that moves the `description`, and re-judge every row cold — a suite that passes its own rename and fails on the routing underneath it has tested nothing. **Re-anchored to v1.0.0 (wright re-baseline), 2026-07-31:** the member was renamed to the wright motif and its version designation reset to 1.0.0; suite content carried forward unchanged, no case, input, assert, or count moved. Earlier version numbers in this line are predecessor-era designations. **Re-anchored to v1.0.2, 2026-08-05:** the `description` gained "hooks" in the artifact list (952 → 959 chars per `build.py`'s regex; the 946 recorded above is a predecessor-era count). No row, expectation, or count moved. The routing surface changed, so the cold re-judge of every row is **owed, not claimed**; a hook-shaped probe ("write the hook for this rule") now has an advertised landing and is worth adding as a should-row when the re-judge runs. The registry's rigwright ↔ tokenwright seam row (2026-08-05) is carried on tokenwright's side — this description deliberately gained no clause for it. **Re-anchored to v1.1.0, 2026-08-12:** that decision is reversed by finding 9 of the 2026-08-12 estate audit — the boundary now closes from both sides, so the description's closing boundary gains the tokenwright clause (a pure token or cost cut on a config whose layout is already right), with compensating trims holding the length at 962 chars. Body changes in the same release: the handed-in-material injection rule promoted to Turn shape rule 5 (findings 10), and the Refresh entry gained the fetched-page injection rule and search-unavailable fallback (findings 2, 14). The routing surface moved, so the cold re-judge of every row — owed since 1.0.2 — is still owed, now against the tokenwright-clause text; a boundary probe ("slim my CLAUDE.md, the layout is fine") is worth adding as a shouldn't-row when it runs. No row, expectation, or count moved this pass. **Re-anchored to v1.1.1, 2026-08-17:** body and reference changes only (the 2026-08-17 member audit + security scan — `surface-notes.md` refresh, `artifact-templates.md` emit-rule tightening, step-level data-rule pointers, two injection probes in `test-cases.md`); the description is byte-identical to 1.1.0's at 962 chars, so the routing surface these 20 queries judge did not move — no row, expectation, or count touched; still **20, 10/10**. **The cold re-judge owed since 1.0.2 was DISCHARGED 2026-08-20** (`evals/RESULTS.md`): all 20 rows judged cold by an independent judge holding only the listing and the queries, closing the debt this line had carried since 1.0.2. This line read "remains owed" for three more re-anchors after that close — corrected here 2026-09-10 (estate finding `eval-ledgers-underreport-executed-probes`); nothing else about those three re-anchors changes. **Re-anchored to v1.1.2, 2026-09-09 — provenance only, nothing executed here:** a Fetch scope clause was added to Entry — Refresh (body-only; estate finding `foundation-fetch-members-name-no-domain-allow-list`). The `description` is byte-identical, so the routing surface these 20 queries judge did not move; no row, expectation, or count touched. **Re-anchored to v1.1.3, 2026-09-09 — provenance only, nothing executed here:** an inventory-mode paragraph was added to Entry — Audit (body-only). The `description` is byte-identical, so the routing surface these 20 queries judge did not move; no row, expectation, or count touched. **Re-anchored to v1.1.4, 2026-09-10 — provenance only, nothing executed here:** Placement — the layer stack gained the live/tracked-pair diff rule, folded into the Audit `rot` check (body-only; task-observer observation #0003). The `description` is byte-identical, so the routing surface these 20 queries judge did not move; no row, expectation, or count touched. **Re-anchored to v1.1.5, 2026-09-10 — provenance only, nothing executed here:** `evals/test-cases.md` gained Cases 17-18 (estate finding `rigwright-two-authored-not-covered-eval-gaps`), executed 2/2; not a routing-surface row, so no query, expectation, or count here moved. **Re-anchored to v1.1.6, 2026-09-10 — provenance only, nothing executed here:** Placement — the layer stack gained a private-path-leakage line (body-only; task-observer observations #0013, #0026). The `description` is byte-identical, so the routing surface these 20 queries judge did not move; no row, expectation, or count touched.

**Method.** Read each query cold against **name + description only** — never the body. Routing is set at the description level; a miss here is a description defect, not a body defect. Judge, then compare to the expected column.

**Counts:** 20 queries — **10 SHOULD** · **10 SHOULD NOT**.

## Should fire

| # | Query | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | "Set up a Claude Project for my client research work" | Named surface, build intent |
| 2 | "Write me a CLAUDE.md for this repo" | Named artifact |
| 3 | "My project instructions are a mess — can you tighten them?" | Fix intent on a named surface |
| 4 | "Should this rule go in my CLAUDE.md or a skill?" | The placement question, verbatim |
| 5 | "What belongs in profile preferences vs project instructions?" | Placement across two named layers |
| 6 | "My CLAUDE.md is 400 lines and Claude ignores half of it" | Bloat symptom on a named artifact |
| 7 | "Score my repo's Claude config" | The audit entry |
| 8 | "rigwright audit" | Quoted invocation keyword |
| 9 | "I need a .mcp.json for this project's servers" | Named artifact in scope |
| 10 | "Plan the knowledge files for a Project about our pricing policy" | Knowledge-file plan, named |

## Should not fire

| # | Query | Routes to | Why it's a near-miss |
|---|---|---|---|
| 11 | "Build me a skill that formats changelogs" | skillwright | Config-shaped verb, skill object |
| 12 | "Audit this SKILL.md against best practices" | skillwright | Shares the `audit` verb |
| 13 | "Make this a weekly Cowork task" | agentwright | Setup-shaped, but unattended |
| 14 | "Set up a routine that reviews PRs on merge" | agentwright | "Set up" is rigwright's verb; the object runs unattended |
| 15 | "Edit the SKILL.md for my desktop scheduled task" | agentwright | **Sharpest pair.** Filename says skill, object is a scheduled task |
| 16 | "What guardrails should my scheduled agent have?" | agentwright | Runtime authority |
| 17 | "Rewrite this system prompt so it stops rambling" | promptwright | Instruction text with no layer question |
| 18 | "Trim the token cost of my CLAUDE.md" | tokenwright | **Sharp pair.** Same artifact, cost motive not placement motive |
| 19 | "Apply our brand palette to the project README" | brandwright | Identity, not configuration |
| 20 | "Draft the announcement telling the team about the new Project" | commwright | Message to a channel |

## Edge notes

**Sharpest boundary pair: #15 against #2.** Both name a `SKILL.md`. The deciding property is the *object*, never the filename: a desktop scheduled task is stored on disk as a `SKILL.md` and is still agentwright's, because a filename describes the format and not the thing. rigwright's description carries this by claiming attended standing configuration and routing "anything that runs unattended" away by name; agentwright's claims scheduled tasks positively. If #15 fires rigwright, the fix is on rigwright's boundary sentence, not on agentwright's.

**Second-sharpest: #18 against #6.** Identical artifact, opposite motive. A cost cue ("trim the token cost", "too expensive") is tokenwright; a placement or effectiveness cue ("Claude ignores half of it", "is this in the right file") is rigwright. A bare "shorten my CLAUDE.md" carries neither cleanly and is a genuine coin-flip — recorded as a known ambiguity rather than papered over, and the honest resolution in a live run is to ask which, once.

**#13 and #14 test the same seam from the setup side.** rigwright owns the verbs *set up*, *configure*, *scaffold*; agentwright owns the objects those verbs are applied to when nobody is watching the result. The verb cannot decide it, which is why both descriptions carry the object test.

**Tuning rule.** Misses on the should-set → the description's triggers need to be pushier, most likely by naming a surface the query used. Fires on the should-not set → tighten the boundary sentence, and check whether the sibling's description makes its own positive claim; a boundary held from one side only is the failure mode this pack has already hit twice.
