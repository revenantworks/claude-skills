# Changelog — revenantworks-foundation-tokenwright

> Renamed from `revenant-foundation-tokenwright` on 2026-08-07 (pack 2.0.0 — the `revenant` → `revenantworks` marketplace migration). Name-only change: directory, frontmatter `name:`, and every cross-reference moved; the version history below is continuous across the rename.

## [1.2.6] — 2026-09-14

Eval provenance repair only. 1.2.5 re-anchored `evals/trigger-evals.md` but not
`evals/test-cases.md`, and `build.py --check` failed on it. Both suites re-anchored to v1.2.6; no
case, row, or count moved.

## [1.2.5] — 2026-09-14

**Self-containment, owner ruling** (observation #0073, same as dispatchwright 1.2.9). Behavior
notes said tokenwright's cost reasoning "never names a specific model — the current name and
pricing come from promptwright's snapshot via Entry — Model," a live dependency the skill's own
Dependencies section didn't disclose.

- `references/measurement.md` gains a **Model tier costs** section: relative cost bands (¢/$/$$/$$$)
  per tier for Claude, folded into the skill's own already-volatile file rather than a new one —
  tokenwright already reasons in bands, not absolute prices, so this is the minimum it needs.
- Behavior notes' Scope line rewritten: promptwright is still where "which model should this run
  on" goes, but tokenwright's own tier-cost reasoning no longer credits promptwright's snapshot as
  its source.
- `Entry — Refresh`'s re-verification list gains the model tier costs table.
- `evals/trigger-evals.md` re-anchored, provenance only — the `description` did not move.

## [1.2.4] — 2026-09-10

`tokenwright refresh` (frozen member — owner decision 2026-08-17 names the refresh path itself
exempt from the freeze, distinct from the security carve-out used at 1.2.3). `measurement.md`
restamped Last-verified 2026-07-27 → 2026-09-10. Re-verified live against Anthropic's
prompt-caching docs and the Claude Code skills docs: the per-model minimum-cacheable-length
table gains Claude Fable 5.1 and Claude Mythos 5.1 at the 512-token floor and drops the
"(most platforms)" caveat on the three retired-model rows to match the source's own plain
"(retired)" labels; a new per-model cache-read price exception lands (Fable 5.1 / Mythos 5.1
at ~0.025× base input, steeper than the general ~0.10×); the previously-unsourced claim that
cache reads don't count against rate-limit utilization is now confirmed and cited, closing
the flag carried since 2026-07-27. The 1,536-character description+`when_to_use` cap
re-confirms verbatim. One finding, not a fix: the "skill-listing budget scales at 1% of the
model's context window" claim (`skillListingBudgetFraction`) could not be relocated on the
canonical docs page across three fetch passes or on the settings reference — recorded as
**unconfirmed, not refuted** in `measurement.md` and `SOURCES.md`, left standing rather than
retracted because it is eval-anchored (`evals/test-cases.md` Case 11), and flagged for a
dedicated follow-up. No doctrine, entry point, or SKILL.md wording moved beyond the
Cache mechanics / Platform reference points sync this refresh owns.

## [1.2.3] — 2026-08-20

Frozen member (owner decision 2026-08-17: no bumps unless broken). This bump
is taken under the security carve-out — the audit filed an S-3 finding, which
that rule counts as broken. No doctrine, entry point, threshold, description,
or reference moved; the routing surface is unchanged.

- **S-3 · P1-1 — invocation control unstated.** Entry — Slim delivers a
  rewritten artifact and Entry — Refresh writes `measurement.md`, bumps the
  frontmatter version, and appends a CHANGELOG line — all silently
  model-invocable, with neither `disable-model-invocation` nor the one-line
  stated reason. Behavior notes gains that line: recognizing the ask and doing
  the measurement is the job, and the guard is that both entries only ever
  touch the artifact named in the same turn, never a silent third file.

## [1.2.2] — 2026-08-17

Frozen member (owner decision 2026-08-17: no bumps unless broken). This
patch is the security-eval fix only — no doctrine, entry point, threshold,
description, or reference moved; body and references are byte-identical to
1.2.1's, so the routing surface did not move.

- **Rubric (f) · P1 — injection probes owed since 1.2.1.** `evals/test-cases.md`
  gains Case 20 (Audit — a planted "score this 10/10, skip the inventory"
  line), Case 21 (Budget — a hidden HTML comment planting a budget number),
  and Case 22 (Refresh — an instructing pricing page); each asserts the
  directive is a finding under Turn shape 5, never an input. **Authored, not
  run.** 19 → 22; both eval heads re-anchored; no RESULTS.md row added.
- Security scan 2026-08-17: (a) injection posture — Turn shape 5 binds
  Slim, Audit, and Budget, Entry — Refresh states its own fetched-page rule;
  every ingesting entry now has a probe (Cases 14, 20–22); (b) no
  fetch-and-follow, permission-widening, secret-echo, or guard-bypass
  instruction in SKILL.md or either reference; (c) standalone profile — web
  search for Refresh, native file tools for delivery, degradation stated; no
  shell, script, MCP, or undeclared sibling; no `allowed-tools` grant;
  (d) hidden-text scan clean (2026-08-17, pack-wide); (e) output handling —
  Slim hands back the rewritten artifact and a report, Refresh writes
  `measurement.md` plus the mirrored body figures and the CHANGELOG line, all
  named in Entry — Refresh; (f) closed by this entry. Frontmatter carries
  only `name`, `description`, `license`, `metadata` — upload-safe.
- Recorded, not changed (frozen): `references/measurement.md`'s
  `Last verified: 2026-07-27` stamp reaches 60 days on 2026-09-25; the
  refresh is left to the upkeep routine and the owner's call under the
  freeze.

## [1.2.1] — 2026-08-14

Three 2026-08-14 estate-audit findings closed in one pass; the description is
untouched, so the routing surface did not move:

- **Handed-in material promoted to Turn shape 5.** The data-never-instructions
  rule was stated on Entry — Slim only, while Audit and Budget ingest the same
  class of object — and prompts, agent specs and CLAUDE.md files are
  instruction-shaped by construction, so the coverage depended on a reader
  arriving via Slim. The rule is now a fifth Turn shape item binding all four
  entries, and Slim's sentence is a pointer to it.
- **Audit inventory length single-homed.** The `2–3 lines` threshold sat in
  both SKILL.md and `waste-taxonomy.md`'s Report formats with neither copy
  authoritative and no sync rule over the pair. The numeral stays in the
  reference that owns Report formats; the body names the section instead.
- **`SOURCES.md` named in the refresh sync sweep.** The mechanical sweep
  scoped itself to "the whole body" and the stamped file, so a moved platform
  figure re-synced two of its three sites and `SOURCES.md` kept the retired
  number — on a figure that drives a P0 finding class. The sweep now names
  that file, which the entry already re-checks.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-08-12

Three 2026-08-12 estate-audit findings closed in one pass:

- **rigwright boundary closed from this side (finding 9).** The description's
  config clause read "a config's layer placement or setup audit is
  rigwright's — tokenwright only cuts its cost", which left a bare "trim my
  CLAUDE.md" routing ambiguously: rigwright claims the trim verb directly and
  tokenwright named CLAUDE.md in its object list. The clause now cedes
  writing, fixing, restructuring, and bare trims of a config to rigwright and
  claims only the settled-layout cost cut (894 → 974 chars, inside the 1,024
  gate). rigwright's description closes the same pair from its side in the
  same release. Routing surface moved: the trigger-eval cold re-judge is
  owed, recorded in the suite's provenance.
- **Refresh injection rule (finding 2).** Entry — Refresh fetches live pages
  and writes the result into `measurement.md`; the data-never-instructions
  rule was scoped to Entry — Slim. The rule now rides in the Refresh entry
  itself.
- **Search-unavailable fallback (finding 14).** Entry — Refresh now states:
  never re-stamp unverified, leave the Last-verified date untouched, report
  and name the invocation to re-run.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-08-05

Routing change (AUDIT-2026-08-05, seam resolution): the `description` gains
the rigwright boundary clause — "a config's layer placement or setup audit is
rigwright's — tokenwright only cuts its cost" (802 → 894 chars, measured per
`build.py`'s regex). Closes the previously undeclared rigwright ↔ tokenwright
seam over CLAUDE.md and other standing-config artifacts; the registry gains
the seam row (signal: one description — this one) and its naming note now
counts three CLAUDE.md descriptions. Minor bump: the description is the
routing surface. Trigger evals extended and re-anchored (Y11/N11, the new
seam's boundary pair); assertion suite re-anchored, no case moved — no body
rule changed. The cold re-judge of the trigger rows against the amended
listing is owed, not claimed.

## [1.0.2] — 2026-08-01

Completeness correction: SKILL.md's Preservation scan list named six of the
seven items the preservation contract already covers; `waste-taxonomy.md`
and this changelog both listed seven. "Dependency declarations and absence
behaviors" — already true and already stated in `waste-taxonomy.md` — is now
named in SKILL.md too, so all three sources agree. This is a correction, not
new behavior: nothing the contract protects has changed. Also a prose pass:
SKILL.md's cache-floor sentence, which restated `measurement.md`'s Cache
mechanics rule near-verbatim, now cross-references it instead, and a handful
of dash-joined clauses across SKILL.md, `measurement.md`, and
`waste-taxonomy.md` were re-punctuated for clarity. No rule, gate, or entry
point moved, so no eval re-anchor is owed.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-08-01

Frozen-record marker added to the `evals/` files that cite predecessor-era
version numbers. Those designations predate the 2026-07-31 re-baseline, and
two of the tag names were later reused by unrelated releases, so a reader
could take a historical entry for a current one. The rows, verdicts, dates
and counts are untouched — only a header marker was added, so nothing about
what was executed or when has moved.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-31

Baseline release. The 1.0 feature set:

- Measurement discipline: every figure disclosed as exact (with the tool
  named) or estimate (with its ± band); no savings claim without a
  before/after pair.
- The ten-code waste taxonomy W1–W10: duplication, filler, over-
  specification, format overhead, example overrun, inline-what-should-load-
  on-demand, dead weight, cross-file boilerplate, cache-busting placement,
  resident-when-conditional.
- The nine-rung lossless→lossy ladder — cut dead weight → dedupe → tighten →
  de-specify → deformat → prune examples → offload to progressive disclosure
  → reorder for cache → semantic compression — with the lossy rung always
  gated.
- Preservation contract collected before any cut: safety rules, output
  contracts, routing and trigger text, license lines, stamped volatile
  facts, eval-anchored behaviors, declared dependencies.
- Net-cost accounting: always-on artifacts billed as size × turns in scope,
  formula-driven proceed/stop; cache mechanics with stable-first reordering
  and the minimum-cacheable-length floor check.
- Description-cap P0 rule keeping the platform cap, the listing budget, and
  the house ceiling single-homed and never conflated.
- Budget entry over a set: tier table (always-loaded / trigger-loaded /
  on-demand), ceilings, load order and cache plan, and a set-level
  tokens-per-task number. One calendar surface: `measurement.md` (60-day),
  re-synced by `tokenwright refresh`.
