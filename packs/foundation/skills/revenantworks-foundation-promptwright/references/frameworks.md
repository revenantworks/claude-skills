## Where the choice is made

The menu is in `SKILL.md`, Phase 3 — what each acronym stands for, which job each one wins, the tie-break when two fit, and the rule that a framework the user names is the framework that gets built. It sits on the always-loaded path, so the choice never depends on opening this file.

This file is what you read *after* choosing: components, skeletons, origins, and the caveats belonging to one structure. It does not restate the menu; where the two disagree, this file has drifted.

## CO-STAR — Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, Response

| Component | What it carries |
|---|---|
| Context | Background and situation the writing serves |
| Objective | The specific goal of the piece |
| Style | Structural / format approach (narrative, bullets, subheads every N words) |
| Tone | Voice and emotional quality |
| Audience | Who reads it, what they know, what they value |
| Response | Exact output format and length |

**Skeleton:**

```
CONTEXT:   Business blog for C-level execs exploring AI; readers know strategy, not ML.
OBJECTIVE: Help them grasp practical ML applications and tangible business value.
STYLE:     Professional blog, narrative + bullets, subheads every 150–200 words, 2–3 cases.
TONE:      Authoritative but approachable; practical, not theoretical.
AUDIENCE:  Senior managers who weigh ROI and have limited technical ML knowledge.
RESPONSE:  800-word article — headline (≤10 words), hook, 3–4 sections, CTA close.
```

CO-STAR's distinctive move is splitting **Style** (the writing approach) from **Tone** (the emotional register) — most frameworks merge them. That separation is what makes it strong for voice-sensitive content.

## RISEN — Role, Instructions, Steps, End goal, Narrowing

| Component | What it carries |
|---|---|
| Role | The expertise / perspective needed |
| Instructions | High-level guidance on the task |
| Steps | The explicit methodology, in order |
| End goal | What success looks like |
| Narrowing | Constraints and boundaries |

**Skeleton:**

```
ROLE:       You are a senior data engineer.
INSTRUCTIONS: Process a CSV of user registrations into a clean PostgreSQL table.
STEPS:
  1. Validate email format; reject malformed rows to an error log.
  2. Normalize names (trim, title-case).
  3. Deduplicate on email.
  4. Insert valid rows; report counts.
END GOAL:   A clean table plus a summary of inserted / rejected counts.
NARROWING:  Python + psycopg2 only; never drop existing rows; handle bad data gracefully.
```

RISEN separates the *what* (Instructions), the *how* (Steps), the *why* (End goal), and the *boundaries* (Narrowing). It maps to how you'd brief a skilled colleague.

*Origin: Kyle Balmer. Often described as descending from the earlier RISE pattern; the two do not map letter-for-letter, so the lineage claim is left out rather than stated loosely.*

## TIDD-EC — Task, Instructions, Do, Don't, Examples, Context

| Component | What it carries |
|---|---|
| Task | Nature of the work |
| Instructions | What to accomplish |
| Do | Explicit positive guidance |
| Don't | Explicit things to avoid |
| Examples | Reference samples showing the bar |
| Context | Background |

**Skeleton:**

```
TASK:         Generate a user-facing error message for a failed payment.
INSTRUCTIONS: One clear sentence the user can act on.
DO:           Name the likely cause; give one next step; stay calm and plain.
DON'T:        Blame the user; expose stack traces, codes, or PII; use jargon.
EXAMPLES:
  Good: "Your card was declined. Check the number and expiry, then try again."
  Bad:  "Error 402: txn_auth_fail at gateway node 7."
CONTEXT:      Shown in a checkout modal to non-technical shoppers.
```

The explicit Do / Don't pair is what sets TIDD-EC apart — it tells the model directly which characteristics must and must not appear. Keep the Don't list short and specific; long prohibition stacks backfire (see `anti-patterns.md` #3).

---

## BAB — Before, After, Bridge

| Component | What it carries |
|---|---|
| Before | The current state and what's wrong with it |
| After | The desired end state |
| Bridge | The transformation rules and constraints |

**Skeleton:**

```
BEFORE: <paste current code/copy>. Problems: nested callbacks, no error handling.
AFTER:  Same behavior, async/await, errors surfaced to the caller, unit-testable.
BRIDGE: Preserve the public API; don't add dependencies; keep it under 60 lines;
        add a one-line comment only where logic isn't self-evident.
```

BAB frames the task as a current → target transition with the Bridge carrying the rules. It's a clean fit whenever you already hold the input and want a controlled transformation rather than fresh generation.

*Origin: a community prompt pattern adapted from the classic Before-After-Bridge copywriting structure.*

---

## Chain of Thought (CoT)

Instruct the model to reason in explicit steps, separated from the final answer, and to self-verify before concluding.

**Skeleton:**

```
You are a debugging assistant. A function returns the wrong total for some inputs.

<code>{{code}}</code>
<failing_case>{{input_and_expected}}</failing_case>

Work through this step by step in <reasoning> tags: trace the inputs, find where
the value diverges, and identify the root cause. Then in <answer> tags give the
fix and a one-line explanation. Before finishing, check the fix against the
failing case.
```

> **Target model note:** a native-reasoning model (the current flagship and frontier tiers across major vendors — live lineup in `model-snapshot.md`) already thinks before answering. On those models, explicit "think step by step" framing is redundant or harmful. Reserve CoT scaffolding for non-reasoning / chat models or thinking-off deployments. See `model-notes.md`.

*Research: Wei et al., 2022 — "Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models."*

## RTF — Role, Task, Format (and APE for the ultra-minimal case)

| Component | What it carries |
|---|---|
| Role | The expertise required |
| Task | What to do |
| Format | Output structure |

**Skeleton:**

```
You are a technical editor. Rewrite the paragraph below to be clearer and 20%
shorter, preserving all facts. Return only the revised paragraph.

<paragraph>{{text}}</paragraph>
```

**APE — Action, Purpose, Expectation** — for one-off, throwaway prompts where even RTF is too much:

```
Summarize the text below in 3 bullets (Action) so a busy manager gets the gist
(Purpose); each bullet ≤15 words, lead with the decision (Expectation).

<text>{{text}}</text>
```

RTF is the lightest structured option — three components, short prompt, fast output. Reach for it (or APE) before anything heavier when the task is unambiguous.

---

## Agent / System structure — tool-using agents and system prompts

The failure modes here are different from a single-shot prompt: the model has to decide *when to act*, *which tool to call*, and *when to stop*.

Cover these components; drop the ones a given task doesn't need:

| Component | What it carries |
|---|---|
| Role + available tools | Who the agent is and exactly what tools it has, each with a one-line "use it when…" trigger |
| Act vs. ask | The default: proactive ("infer the most useful action and proceed") or conservative ("gather information and recommend rather than act") |
| Confirm shared understanding | For non-trivial implementation work: state the plan or the read of the task in one or two lines before changes that are costly to undo, in whichever of three forms fits who is on the other end — see note below |
| Tool-use discipline | Prefer small, targeted calls over one broad call; define what to do on a tool error (retry once with a narrower input, then report) |
| Parallel tool calls | When multiple calls are independent, run them simultaneously — significant latency win |
| Stop / exit conditions | What "done" looks like; what to do if it cannot finish (report blockers, don't loop) |
| Output contract | What the agent returns at the end, in exactly what shape |

**Confirm shared understanding, before building it in.** An implementation agent that starts changing things before its read of the task matches the caller's is the single most common source of thrown-away work — cheap to prevent, expensive to discover after the fact. Bake in an explicit checkpoint rather than relying on the model to volunteer one, before a change that is slow or costly to undo (a multi-file edit, a schema change, anything touching production or another person's work); a single-file fix or a fully-specified task can skip straight to acting.

The checkpoint takes one of three forms — pick by **who is on the other end when the agent is about to act**, not by habit:

- **Hold** — a person is present in real time and can answer before the agent commits (an interactive coding session, a chat-based assistant). State the plan, then wait for a reply or a timeout before writing anything.
- **Assume** — nobody is present synchronously, but a person will read the output afterward and can act on a wrong call (a PR description, a report, a review comment). State the plan *as a named assumption* ("assuming X, I'll…") and proceed — the assumption is the thing a reader corrects, not a live gate.
- **State, then proceed** — the agent runs unattended with no synchronous party and no reader positioned to intervene before the effect lands (a ticket-driven pipeline, a scheduled job). There is nothing to hold for and no one to address an assumption to; the checkpoint's only job is to make the agent's read of the task visible in its own output — a log line, a report field — so a wrong read is catchable on review rather than invisible. Do not write this form as if it were Hold ("pausing for your input…") when no pause actually happens; that overclaims a gate the agent isn't providing.

Get this wrong in either direction and the checkpoint fails at its one job: **Hold** written for an unattended agent blocks forever on a reply that never comes; **State, then proceed** written for an interactive one lets a wrong read commit before the person watching ever sees it. Name which form a given build needs from the task's own interaction model — who reads or answers, and when — never default to one form without checking. Keep whichever form is chosen cheap — one or two lines, not a question list — so it earns its place against the Act vs. ask row rather than reintroducing the padding that row exists to avoid. This is a different layer from Phase 4: Phase 4 clarifies the request *promptwright* is building from; this component, once written into the prompt, makes the *built agent* do the same before it acts.

**Skeleton:**

```
You are a release assistant with these tools:
  - run_tests(): use before any tagging step.
  - read_file(path) / write_file(path, content): use to edit changelog entries.

By default, take the next release step rather than asking; if a step is ambiguous,
infer the most useful action and proceed, using read_file to confirm rather than
guessing. Make small, targeted tool calls. If a tool errors, retry once with a
narrower input, then report and stop.

Before any change touching more than one file, state in one line what you're
about to do and why, then proceed — don't wait for a reply unless something is
genuinely ambiguous.

Stop when the changelog is updated and tests pass, OR report the blocker if tests
fail. Return a two-line summary: what changed and the test result.
```

The "right altitude" for a system prompt sits between hardcoding brittle if-then logic and vague hand-waving. Bloated tool sets with overlapping triggers are a common failure mode — curate a minimal viable set.

## Advanced / critique set — stress-testing and verifying

Reach for these when the goal is to *harden or check* a prompt or an answer, not to draft fresh content. Keep them compact; they are tools, not a checklist to run every time.

| Technique | When to use |
|---|---|
| **Self-Refine** | Generate, then critique the draft against criteria, then revise. One pass usually suffices; it catches sloppy first drafts cheaply. |
| **Red-team (Devil's Advocate / Pre-Mortem)** | Argue the strongest case *against* the prompt or plan, or imagine it has already failed and explain why. Surfaces failure modes a forward pass misses. |
| **RCoT (Reverse Chain of Thought)** | Have the model restate the requirements from its own draft and check that none were dropped or contradicted. Good for multi-constraint tasks where a requirement quietly gets lost. |
| **Chain of Density** | For summarization: produce an initial summary, then iterate — each round adds missing entities while keeping length fixed. Yields a dense, information-rich summary. |

**Self-Refine skeleton:**

```
Draft a response to {{input}}. Then, in <critique> tags, judge it against these
criteria: {{criteria}}. List concrete weaknesses. Then in <final> tags, output a
revised version that fixes them. Show only the <final> block to the user.
```

## Prompt chaining — when to split a task across multiple prompts

A single prompt is the right default. Chain only when one prompt genuinely can't hold the whole task.

**Chain when:**
- The output of step A is the input of step B and can't be known upfront.
- The context window can't hold the full input + instructions + expected output at once.
- Different steps need different models, temperatures, or tools.
- Reliability matters: checkpointed steps make failures easier to isolate and retry.

**Don't chain when:**
- The task fits in one prompt and the model can hold all context comfortably.
- Latency matters more than reliability (each link adds round-trip time).
- The steps aren't truly sequential — parallel calls are faster.

**Handoff format:** pass only what the next step needs, not the full conversation history. Wrap the handoff in a clear tag: `<step1_output>…</step1_output>`. State in the next prompt what the block contains and what to do with it.

**Context hygiene:** summarize or compress intermediate outputs before passing them forward. A chain that accumulates full outputs at every step will hit the context limit faster than one that passes lean summaries.

---

## Long-context structuring — where to place data and instructions

When a prompt carries large inputs (20k+ tokens), placement matters as much as wording.

| Rule | Why it works |
|---|---|
| **Data at the top, question at the end.** Put long documents and inputs above the query, instructions, and examples. | For Claude, this ordering can lift quality by up to ~30% on complex, multi-document inputs. |
| **Avoid the middle for anything critical.** | Models attend least to the middle of a long context ("lost in the middle"). Put the most important instructions at the start or the end. |
| **Ground in quotes.** Ask the model to first quote the relevant passages, then answer. | Cuts through surrounding noise and reduces hallucination. |
| **Tag the structure.** Wrap each document in clear tags with source/metadata (e.g. `<document index="1">`). | Lets the model tell documents apart and cite which one it used. |
