# revenantworks-foundation-promptwright

A prompt-engineering skill for agentic LLMs. Turns a rough idea, a set of parameters, or an existing prompt into a scored, copy-paste-ready artifact. What separates it from framework-based prompt builders:

- Every prompt ships with a **model recommendation** routed by capability tier (Claude, or a local open-weights model the user runs; another hosted vendor gets a vendor-neutral prompt, unrouted).
- Every draft gets a **hostile read** — the prompt as a maximally-literal model would take it, hunting lines that can be obeyed while defeating the intent.
- Model data self-updates via a snapshot with a 60-day staleness rule (`promptwright refresh`).
- Finished prompts export as savable offline **HTML prompt cards**.
- A lean load budget caps a standard build at two reference reads.
- Restraint rules keep it from building prompts that shouldn't exist.

Name a framework and you get it — CO-STAR, RISEN, TIDD-EC, BAB, RTF/APE, Chain of Thought, Agent/System — with what each stands for and which job it wins carried in the skill itself. Say nothing and promptwright picks.

**Workflow:** Intake → Analyze + Score → Pick structure → Clarify (only if needed) → Build → Re-score & self-check → Output

Prompts are scored on five dimensions (clarity, specificity, context, completeness, structure) and reported as a before → after delta, so improvement is visible rather than asserted. Every delivered prompt leads with a plain-language **TL;DR** and a mandatory **Model** line naming what to run it on.

## Install

Follows the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) open standard. Drop the folder into your skills directory or upload the archive in Claude settings. Trigger it by saying `promptwright`, by handing it a prompt to improve, by asking which model to run a prompt on, or by describing what you want to build (audience, tone, format, model, constraints) — it assembles the prompt. Self-contained, declares no tool restriction; uses web search sparingly for model-lineup verification. No shell required.

## Entry points

| Entry | What it does |
|---|---|
| **build** | Idea or parameters → seven-phase pipeline → prompt in a code block under the Phase 7 header, with a footer (TL;DR, Model line, before → after score, structure) and the Keep going selection |
| **improve** | An existing prompt → score → confirm structure → rebuild → re-score, with a `Changed` diff instead of the phase ladder |
| **score** | "score this / don't rewrite" → the five-dimension baseline + top findings, no rewrite |
| **red-team** | "red-team this prompt", or an adversarial read asked for by name → skips the build and runs the Phase 6 hostile read as the deliverable — binding lines and findings reported, repairs only on request |
| **model** | `promptwright model` → recommend a tier + model for a live task (no prompt built); tier taxonomy is durable, names from the snapshot |
| **slim** | `promptwright slim` → cut a prompt's tokens with behavior held constant: lossless rungs apply, lossy cuts gate, every count names its method; a skill package's slim is skillwright's, standing config's rigwright's |
| **refresh** | `promptwright refresh` → re-verify and regenerate `model-snapshot.md` only; patch bump + repackage |

A **quiet build** ("quiet build" / "just the prompt") collapses Phases 1–6 into one trace line. The **Fast path** is the same collapse taken on the skill's own judgment, and only for a genuinely small prompt: one task, no ambiguous gaps, an RTF/APE shape, nothing production-bound or high-stakes. Its exit conditions are published — ambiguity, a knowledge vacuum, a restraint case, or reaching for a second reference file all restart the full build in the same turn — because a short route with no exit is how a build gets skipped rather than shortened. Either way the 15 self-checks and the hostile read run in full. The **HTML prompt card** is hard opt-in — produced only via the Keep going selection or an explicit request — and carries a mandatory **Run on** section so a saved card never strands its reader.

## Commands & switches

Named invocations — everything else routes on natural requests ("write me a prompt that…", "improve this prompt", "which model should run this?"):

| Invocation | What it does |
|---|---|
| `promptwright` | Bare invocation — capability line naming the refresh subcommand, then asks what to write or improve |
| `promptwright model` | Recommend a capability tier + the cheapest model clearing it for a live task — flip condition included; no prompt produced. Names come from `model-snapshot.md` (tier-name fallback past the stamp) |
| `promptwright optimize` | Improve a prompt by measured runs against a 3–8-case slice with one holdout; stops on plateau, oscillation, overfit or cost. Can emit promptfoo or GEPA/DSPy configs as text |
| `promptwright slim` | Cut what a prompt costs per call without changing what it does; `slim audit` scores the waste without rewriting |
| `promptwright refresh` | Re-verify model lineups against the canonical sources in `references/model-snapshot.md`; regenerate the snapshot only, patch bump + repackage. Run at the 60-day stamp or when a major model launches |

| In-request switch | Effect |
|---|---|
| "just build it" | Skips or exits any clarification round; builds on stated smart assumptions |
| "quiet build" / "just the prompt" | Collapses Phases 1–6 into one trace line — footer, Model line, Keep going selection unchanged |
| "interview me" | Opt-in requirement interview in short question batches for fuzzy specs; exit any time with "just build it" |
| "use CO-STAR" / any named framework | Honored as named — its components become the prompt's sections; a poor fit costs one line of comment, never a substitution. An acronym the skill doesn't carry is asked about, never guessed at |
| "try [structure] instead" | Switches the framework and rebuilds — no pushback, no re-asked intake |
| Keep going options | `harden + examples` · `switch model` · `generate savable prompt card` · `run it now` — tappable after any delivered prompt (or typed any time) |

## Staying current

Two volatile surfaces, declared in `volatile.json`. `SOURCES.md` is **calendar** (90-day) for its Parity register, the incumbents this skill was last measured against. `references/model-snapshot.md` is **calendar** (60-day) — current model names, cost bands, and context quirks behind a single **Last-verified** stamp (durable tier-routing logic stays in `model-routing.md`). Say **`promptwright refresh`** to re-research current lineups against the vendor docs and registries in the snapshot, regenerate that file only, bump the patch, and (on claude.ai) hand back a repackaged skill. Past the stamp the skill verifies before naming a model, and recommends by **tier name** if it can't — never a possibly-retired string.
