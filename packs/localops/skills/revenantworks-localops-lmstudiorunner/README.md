# revenantworks-localops-lmstudiorunner

Hands work to a local model served by LM Studio, and answers the two questions
that decide whether that was a good idea: **is this task the right shape for a
local model**, and **is the right model installed to do it**.

It carries no model names. It reads what is actually installed, every run.

## Why another one of these

Three skills already delegate to LM Studio. Two of them hardcode their
recommended models, which is exactly the guidance that rots. The best of them,
[`delegate-local`](https://github.com/IsmaelMartinez/delegate-local), routes by
capability tier and audits against hardware — and says plainly that its
verification is lightweight and its use is in-session.

This one claims the part none of them do: **the unattended path, where nobody
reads the output before it is used.** That is a different problem, and it needs
a different rule.

## The two modes

**Interactive** — you are present and will read the result. A check is
recommended, not required. Your eyes are the check.

**Unattended** — nobody is watching, and the result gets committed or acted on
before anyone reads it. A check is required, and work without one is refused.

The line is **who reads the result and when** — never how big or important the
task is. The reason is a failure that actually happened: a local model produced
a test file that could not parse, the runner dropped the whole script, and the
suite still printed `11/11 passed`. A person reading the output would have
caught it instantly. Nobody was reading.

## What it does that the others don't

- **Reads the live model metadata** — `type`, `arch`, `quantization`, `state`,
  real context lengths, advertised `capabilities` — from LM Studio's native
  API. It can never recommend a model you don't have, and it never carries a
  list that goes stale.
- **Checks loaded context against maximum.** A model loaded at a fraction of
  its ceiling silently truncates long input, and the OpenAI-compatible endpoint
  doesn't show it. On the machine this was built against, the gap was 12,288
  against 262,144.
- **Prefers schema-constrained generation** to validating afterwards — and
  states the limit: a schema constrains shape, never content.
- **Diagnoses failures by shape.** Empty output from budget exhaustion on a
  reasoning model is a different problem from looping on a long list, and the
  fixes point in opposite directions — one wants a bigger budget, the other
  gets worse with one.
- **Scores tasks before delegating**, and often says don't.

## Entry points

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `lmstudiorunner audit` | Score installed models against the work classes; report gaps and the context check |
| `lmstudiorunner size <task>` | Score one task — class, fit, mode, the check it needs |
| `lmstudiorunner queue <task>` | Write a task card; refuse an unattended card with no check |
| `lmstudiorunner run` | Work the queue, verify each unit, report |
| `lmstudiorunner status` | What is queued, running, done, set aside |
| `lmstudiorunner refresh` | Re-verify the API surface notes and restamp them |

## Requirements

A running LM Studio server on this machine. The skill discovers the port rather
than assuming 1234, and tries `127.0.0.1` as well as `localhost` — on Windows
the name can resolve to IPv6 while the server binds IPv4.

No packages. No cloud network at runtime. Where the surface has no shell, it
hands back the exact `curl` commands instead of running them.

## Running it in Bionic

LM Studio's Bionic agent loads SKILL.md files directly and needs only `name`
and `description`. This skill uses no Claude Code-only frontmatter key, so it
works in both places unchanged.

One caution if you run it there: Bionic's own local model would be both the
executor and the judge of its own output. Keep the check external — a test
command, a schema, a count — which is what the skill asks for anyway.

## What it is not

It doesn't pick cloud models or tiers (promptwright), write prompt text
(promptwright), or design the cadence, guardrails and kill switch around a
scheduled run (agentwright). It never commits, pushes, or sends — it prepares,
verifies, and reports.

## Honest economics

This does not save tokens. Writing a good task card costs more than doing a
small task yourself. What it converts is **idle hardware and idle hours** into
work, and it pays off on volume and on cards that get re-run — never on a
single small unit. The skill says so rather than selling the saving.
